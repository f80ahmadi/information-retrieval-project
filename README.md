# Text Preprocessing Practice Project
A small practice project to learn text preprocessing using Python. The goal was to get an idea of how tokenization, normalization,stemming and Precision and Recall calculation works. 

## What it does
- Tokenizes text into words using RegexpTokenizer. (keeping abbreviations like U.S.A, removing "'s" )
- Normalizes text (lowercase, deal with abbreviations)
- Stems words using SnowballStemmer.
- Removes stopwords.
- Compares processed tokens to a gold standard by computing precision and recall.
